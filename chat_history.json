Here's a plan for the initial version, focusing on core features and a clean design:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Dashboard:** A welcoming home screen displaying key information like total sales, machine status (operational/out of service), and low stock alerts.\n*   **Machine Management:** A screen to view and manage individual vending machines. This would include details like location, product inventory, and maintenance logs.\n*   **Inventory Tracking:** A feature to track the stock levels of each product in each machine, with options to update quantities and receive low-stock notifications.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Base color: Light gray or off-white for a clean background.\n    *   Primary text color: Dark gray or black for readability.\n    *   Accent colors: A primary color like a muted blue or green to highlight interactive elements and key information. A secondary accent color (e.g., orange or yellow) for alerts or warnings.\n*   **Typography:**\n    *   Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" (the default) or \"Roboto\" for a professional look. Ensure good readability with appropriate font sizes and line heights.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-01T02:57:09.943743"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a vending machine management system with React Native and Expo 54.
